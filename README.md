I was able to complete:
 Extended Euclidean algorithm (1%)
Chinese Remainder Theorem
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and El Gamal
Miller-Rabin Primality Test 
and get Elliptic Curve working but not quite accurate i don't think.

I have a makefile in there. 
to run it initially do: make in the terminal 
and then ./main to run the code

that will run the main.cpp file that is calling the functions. For the ones i have individual directories for each operation. For diffie hellman it is implemented but not called. 
Some of the functions are used in El Gamal though too
